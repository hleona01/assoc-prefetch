# assoc-prefetch

Study of the effects of associativity and prefetchers on L3 miss rate, Peak Dynamic Power, and instructions per cycle (IPC) on a 16384 MB L3 cache using Sniper Multi-Core Simulator 7.3.

Associativity: 1-way (direct mapped), 2-way, 4-way, 8-way, 16-way, 32-way, 64-way, 128-way, and 256-way (fully associative for a 16384 MB cache) last level cache associativities.

Prefetchers: no prefetcher, simple prefetcher, and the Global History Buffer (GHB) prefetcher.
